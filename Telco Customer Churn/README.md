Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
This project analyzes a telecom customer dataset to identify key factors influencing churn, generate actionable insights, and build a data-driven dashboard to support strategic business decisions.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Analyst workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL-based business queries, visualization, and Power BI dashboard reporting.

Objectives

Identify key drivers of customer churn

Analyze churn patterns across customer demographics, contracts, billing, and services

Segment customers based on tenure, charges, and service usage

Provide actionable retention insights

Develop an executive-level Power BI dashboard for business decision-making

Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

Telco Customer Churn Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/telcom-customer-churn-dataset

This dataset contains customer demographic information, service subscriptions, billing details, and churn status, making it suitable for analyzing churn behavior and identifying retention opportunities.

Key Business Insights

Customers on month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn rates.

Electronic check payment users exhibit the highest churn percentage.

Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn compared to long-term customers.

Customers with higher monthly charges demonstrate increased churn probability.

Certain service combinations correlate strongly with churn behavior.
